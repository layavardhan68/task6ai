## 🧠 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification & Visualization

This project implements the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for classification using the Iris dataset. It explores model performance across different values of K and visualizes decision boundaries using 2D features.

---

### 🎯 Objective

* Implement and evaluate the KNN algorithm on a real-world dataset
* Experiment with different values of K
* Analyze performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix
* Visualize decision boundaries to understand model behavior

---

### 🧰 Tools & Libraries

* Python 3.x
* `scikit-learn`
* `pandas`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn` (for enhanced plots)
* `numpy`

### 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/knn-classification.git
   cd knn-classification
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

### 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python knn_combined.py
```

---

### 📊 What It Does

* Loads and normalizes the **Iris dataset**
* Splits data into training and testing sets
* Trains **KNN models** for K = 1 to 15
* Prints **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **classification report**
* Plots:

  * Accuracy vs. K
  * Decision boundary (using 2 features: sepal length & width)

---

### 📈 Sample Output

* **Best K Value** with corresponding accuracy
* **Confusion Matrix** showing true vs predicted values
* **Classification Report**: Precision, Recall, F1-Score
* **Accuracy vs K Plot**
* **2D Decision Boundary Visualization**

---

### 🌸 Dataset Used

* **Iris Dataset** (from `sklearn.datasets`)
* 150 samples of iris flowers
* Features: Sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width
* Labels: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica
